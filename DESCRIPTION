Description: GeoRouteR is an R package for routing and isochrone analysis
    on spatial data. With GeoRouteR, users can easily calculate and visualize
    routes between locations on a graph-based network, as well as generate
    isochrone maps to visualize accessibility and travel time. The package
    includes functions for efficient routing on large graphs, as well as
    tools for network analysis and spatial data manipulation.
